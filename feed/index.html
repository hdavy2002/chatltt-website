										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-small-font-size">ChatLTT, like many AI training platforms, has file size limitations that users need to navigate. This guide will walk you through the process of splitting large audio files to meet ChatLTT&#8217;s 20MB upload limit.</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding the File Size Limit</h5>



<p>ChatLTT has implemented a 20MB file upload limit for AI training. This means that any file you want to use to train your AI must be smaller than 20MB. However, many audio files, especially those extracted from YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook videos, often exceed this limit.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Solution: File Splitting</h5>



<p>To overcome this limitation, you can split your large audio files into smaller chunks. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to do this using a free tool called File Splitter.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Download File Splitter</h5>



<p>File Splitter is a freeware program that doesn&#8217;t require installation. You can download it from [download link <a href="https://www.filesplitter.org/Free-File-Splitter-v5.0.1189.exe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.filesplitter.org/Free-File-Splitter-v5.0.1189.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>].</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="519" height="347" src="https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file_splitter_split_files.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10383" srcset="https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file_splitter_split_files.png 519w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file_splitter_split_files-300x201.png 300w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file_splitter_split_files-200x134.png 200w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file_splitter_split_files-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></figure></div>


<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Split Your File</h5>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Open File Splitter and choose the audio file you want to split.</li>



<li>Select a destination folder where File Splitter will save the chunks.</li>



<li>Click the split button to begin the process.</li>
</ol>



<p>For example, if your source file is named &#8220;youtube_audio.mp3&#8221;, File Splitter will create files named:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>youtube_audio.mp3.chunk001</li>



<li>youtube_audio.mp3.chunk002</li>



<li>youtube_audio.mp3.chunk003</li>



<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3: Rename and Upload</h5>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rename the chunks to something more manageable, like:</li>
</ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>part1.mp3</li>



<li>part2.mp3</li>



<li>part3.mp3</li>
</ul>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to your ChatLTT AI upload section.</li>



<li>Upload each chunk one by one.</li>
</ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="497" src="https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-1024x497.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10384" srcset="https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-300x146.jpg 300w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-768x373.jpg 768w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-200x97.jpg 200w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842-800x389.jpg 800w, https://chatltt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-054842.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Success</h5>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Always ensure each chunk is under 20MB to comply with ChatLTT&#8217;s upload limit.</li>



<li>Keep your chunks organized by using a consistent naming convention.</li>



<li>Consider compressing your audio files before splitting if they&#8217;re still too large after splitting.</li>
</ul>



<p>By following this guide, you can easily work around ChatLTT&#8217;s file size limitations and successfully upload your large audio files for AI training.</p>
